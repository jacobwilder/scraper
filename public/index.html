      <h1>Futurism</h1>
      <h2><i>noun</i></h2>
        <h3> An artistic movement begun in Italy in 1909 that violently rejected traditional forms so as to celebrate
             and incorporate into art the energy and dynamism of modern technology. Launched by Filippo Marinetti, it 
             had effectively ended by 1918 but was widely influential, particularly in Russia on figures such as Malevich
              and Mayakovsky.</h3>
